                Hello! I'm Nick Shockey. I am a recent and driven graduate looking to gain professional experience with multiple open-source projects under my belt. 
                With about a 3.7 GPA, I was able to make the Deanâ€™s List for most semesters and achieved Magnum Cum Laude. 
                I am a hard worker that is currently looking for work in IT, programming, or software development. 
                This e-portfolio will tell you about my professional goals, skills, and experience.
