# Nick Shockey's Résumé

Presenting to you: another React résumé. Extremely original yet extremely useful for showing off.

# Building
1. Install [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) if you haven't already. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) is also recommended.
2. Clone this repo. Usually with `git clone https://github.com/njshockey/bst-graph.git`.
3. Open the root directory in your terminal and install the necessary npm packages with `npm install` or `yarn`.
4. To run the development server to test changes, run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` and to build the production version, run `npm run build` or `yarn run build`. Built files will be in the dist folder.
    -  To preview the build, run `npm run preview` or `yarn run preview`.
